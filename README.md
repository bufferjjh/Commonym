This is the source code for [Commonym.io](https://www.commonym.io/), a fast-paced 🏃 single and multiplayer word game with <b>three</b> modes. Commonym.io uses [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)⚡ for bi-directional communication between the clients and the server and various [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) components for a clean and minimalistic user interface. [This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words.txt) dataset was used for validating words ✅.

<h1>
RapidRecall
</h1>
<p>RapidRecall is a single-player mode where players race the clock ⏰ brainstorming words that fit certain requirements. If a player fails to submit a word in time, the player loses a life. A player starts with three lives ❤️ and can win extra lives by thinking of special words including palindromes or an element of the periodic table🧪! The score is the total number of characters entered during the game.</p>

<h1>
Countdown
</h1>
<p>
Countdown is a 1🆚1 multiplayer game mode🎮where each player races to use all 26 letters of the alphabet first. <b>The word you use must start with the last letter of the opponent&#39;s word!</b> But who goes first? 🤔 At the beginning of a game, one letter is given, and whichever player enters a word starting with that letter first gets the first word (a big advantage)! 💣 For each word entered, the letters are marked as used. If a letter is already used, nothing happens. Use the entire alphabet before your opponent! 🏁

WordDraw
</h1>
<p>
WordDraw is a 1🆚1 multiplayer game mode🎮 where the first player to get to 10 points wins. How do players score points? 🤔 Prompts that contain a group of letters are repeatedly given throughout the game. The player who thinks of a word that includes all the letters (in any order) wins the point! 🧠 If a group of letters contains a letter more than once, your word must include the letter <b>at least the number of times</b> in the prompt. For example, if the group was 🆁🅽🅽 , a valid word would be &#34;runner&#34; or &#34;narrowing&#34;, but &#34;run&#34; would not work.
